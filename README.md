# Simple Packet Sniffer

The Simple Packet Sniffer is a Python application designed to capture and analyze network packets traversing a specified network interface. This project demonstrates basic concepts in network programming, packet capturing, and analysis using the scapy library.

## Features

- Packet Capturing: Monitors network traffic on a specified interface.
- HTTP Request Analysis: Detects and extracts information from HTTP requests, including potential login data.
- TCP Filtering: Filters captured packets to focus on TCP traffic.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scapy Library
- Visual Studio Code
